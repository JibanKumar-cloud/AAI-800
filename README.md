# AAI-800
Final Year Project
1) Please run the Data_Preparation_UCF101.ipynb file to download the dataset and train-test split files for video classification model.
2)Once dataset has downloaded give the directory of the file in video_transformers.ipynb file to preprocess the videos.
Note:Preprocessing the videos can take more than 30 minute of time ,so i have used a subsampled processed video numpy file which i have included in the repository to make the process easier.
3)I have done some experiments with size reduction and with number of epochs to improve the model score which will be available in video_transformers_Epoch_Experient.ipynb file.
